* Designed hardware-software co-design to perform access authentication for all the DMA transactions, providing fine-grained spatial and strong temporal legitimacy guarantees.
* Used hardware description languages to integrate the solution between the PCIe bus and memory controller. Evaluated the implemetation with real-world hardware connected to RISC-V SoC on FPGA.
* Conducted detailed characterization about DMA transactions revealing access pecularity.
* Implemented both RISC-V and ARM QEMU emulators to show cross-architecture capability.
* Provided a fully customizable research platform for the community to study DMA and host-peripheral interactions, contributing to enhanced security in modern computing systems.
