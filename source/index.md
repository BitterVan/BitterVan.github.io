# About Me

My name is Xingkai Wang (王行楷). I am interested in system optimization and hardening, especially via exploiting the potential of next-generation hardware or novel microarchitectures.

I get my bachelor degree at Computer Science in June, 2023. I am currently in Zhejiang University as a master student at Cyber Security.
